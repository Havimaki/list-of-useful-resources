# Useful Resources

After years of collecting articles, blog posts, videos and other general bits of knowledge, I found myself scrambling to find the perfect link for the conversation I was having. So here is a collection of said links that I've found to be particularly useful throughout my career thus far.

## If you would like to submit a link...
Yay! Please create a pull request which must include the following:
* a new markdown file within it's respective category (as listed in the directories)
* the markdown filename must be the title of the article and author and be formatted like so:
`article_title_[author_name]-date_of_article`
