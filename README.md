# Useful Resources

After years of collecting articles, blog posts, videos and other general bits of knowledge, I found myself scrambling to find the perfect link for the conversation I was having. So here is a collection of said links that I've found to be particularly useful throughout my career thus far.

## What makes a link  "useful"?
Great question. Really, it's all subjective. However, I've found the most useful articles tend to touch the three following points:
1. Has a clear purpose
2. Explains the concepts in the simplest form
3. Can be considered relevant for more than the last 3 years

Those three points essentially cover (a) the concept, (b)  the way the concept is coveyed and (c) the general purpose of the concept.

## If you would like to submit a link...
Great! Please do so with following steps:
1. Run `make resource` in the terminal. This will create a new file in the selected directory, with all the formatting in place.
2. Populate your newly created file with a one-sentence Elevator Pitch, at least two Notable Quotes and a Conclusion. The conclusion can be a quote pulled from the link that you feel encapsulates the resource's main purpose.
3. Run `make index`. This will update the directory's README file with title, link and Elevator Pitch.
