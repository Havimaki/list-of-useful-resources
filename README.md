# Useful Resources

After years of collecting articles, blog posts, videos and other general bits of knowledge, I found myself scrambling to find the perfect link for the conversation I was having. So here is a collection of said links that I've found to be particularly useful throughout my career thus far.

## What makes a link  "useful"?
Great question. Really, it's all subjective. However, I've found the most useful articles tend to touch the three following points:
1. Has a clear purpose
2. Explains the concepts in the simnplest form
3. Is relevant

## If you would like to submit a link...
Yay! Please create a pull request, following the guidelines below:
### 1. New markdown file 
This file should be added within it's respective category (as listed in the directories). As this may be subjective/matter of opinion, please feel free to add to whichever category you feel best suits the content. 
The markdown filename must be the title of the article and be formatted like so: 
```
article-title-example.md
```
The content of this file should be formatted as specified in [TEMPLATE.md](link).

### 2. Updated README
An addition should also be made to the categories README file. It should include the title of the article, and include the elevator pitch. The title of the article should link the article.
