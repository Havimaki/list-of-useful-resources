Notable Quotes
------
> JavaScript started as a way to make web pages more interactive. Nowadays JavaScript runs in more places than just web browsers â€” it runs on web servers, phones and even robots!

> This is a console, otherwise known as a "command line" or "terminal". Basically it's a way to type one thing at a time into a computer and immediately get the computers answer back. 

> To store values we use things called variables. The word 'variable' means 'can change' and is used because variables can store many different types of values and can change their value many times. They are pretty much like mailboxes. We put something in a variable, like our sentence, and then give the variable an address that we can use to look up the sentence later.

> Functions are a type of value that, well, serve a specific function (AKA purpose or action) for us.

> You might be wondering what other functions are available in JavaScript [...] There are lots built in, standard libraries.

> There is also a lot of JavaScript code available that is not built in. JavaScript from third parties is usually referred to as a "library" or "plugin". 

> Also take note that arrays will always preserve ordering which means they will remember the order in which you added or defined things. Not everything in JavaScript preserves ordering so remember this special property of Arrays!

> So why would you ever use arrays if you can just put your data in objects? Because objects don't remember the order of the keys that you set.

> When you combine different things like this you are making data structures, just like legos!

> This code is synchronous because in order for photo to get uploaded to the tweet, the photo download must be completed. [...] Synchronous code is fine for things that happen fast, but it's horrible for things that require saving, loading, downloading or uploading. [...] Hopefully you can see now that callbacks are just functions that call other functions after some asynchronous task.

Conclusion
------
> JavaScript is a programming language or, in other words, a means by which a computer is instructed to do things. [...] All web browsers understand JavaScript and you can take advantage of that to make web pages do crazy things! [...] This page will teach you some JavaScript basics so that you can get up and running in no time.
