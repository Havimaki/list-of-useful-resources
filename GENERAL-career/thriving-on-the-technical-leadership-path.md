Notable Quotes
------
> The management path isn’t the only way to be a technical leader. I don’t wish to become a manager [...] I like being an engineer. In particular, I flourish in a strategic technical leadership role.

> I’ve chosen to cultivate a path for myself that enables me to dig into complex technical and product problem spaces and help lead technical and strategic direction for my organization, as an engineer but not a manager.

> I’ve also found that I can have powerful cultural impact in my organization as a senior engineer rather than manager, like helping cultivate a healthy code review environment or improving an inclusive technical interview process.

> So what does the more strategic work of a very senior engineer look like? It might include:

> * Tackling technical challenges that span multiple technical and organizational systems.

> * Researching and identifying the problems that could be worked on, a year or two from now.

> * Developing prototypes to further explore and support ideas that come from that research.

> * Ramping up strike teams to help build a thing.

> * Looking at the big picture including cultural, product and technical challenges, to help inform choices that would be best for the org, perhaps with a 2-5 year view.

> * Forming strategies, writing proposals and pitching them across the company, for new architecture, systems or approaches.

> * Talking to engineers, technical writers, product managers, interface designers, sales people, lawyers, execs, competitors, peers, and users. Getting people onboard. Marketing ideas. Moving things forward.

> * Acting as an advisor with internal teams, or in customer-facing groups.

> * Sometimes being the voice for change, sometimes being the voice for not change. Always weighing up trade offs, always listening.

> * Being slightly independent of the normal cadence of regular engineering project work. Probably having little guidance or oversight. Possibly being somewhat isolated. Being OK with that.

> * Using that position of independence and power to support and influence other cool/hard/interesting challenges in the organization.
Not being afraid: to question the status quo, to push back on decisions you think would be harmful, or to tackle challenges in unknown territory.
