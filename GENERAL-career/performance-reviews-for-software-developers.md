Notable Quotes
------
> For a performance reviews to be fair, levels and expectations need to be well-defined. If they are not, you can still get good feedback - but it will be subjective feedback.

#### Bad performance reviews
> The type of reviews where there are some fluffy sentences and zero substance. On the surface, the review might look good, with feedback like "Good work" or "Keep doing what you're doing". But when you ask for specifics, your manager cannot give a single example, or constructive feedback.

> You've had a great period, shipping several impactful things. Yet, on the review, none of this is mentioned, only small, sideline things. How is it that they did not call out the big items? 

> The "let's skip straight to the numbers" review.

> During the review, you get some negative feedback, which your manager tries to deliver in a civilized way. So they accompany it with examples. Except those examples are one-sided, miss key details and are mis-interpreted.

> The biased review. I'm not talking about the positively biased, but the negatively biased ones. There could be a recency bias, focusing on a near-term hick-up, but ignoring lots of great work from before. There could be gender bias, especially if you're female, with more focus on your behaviour than your accomplishments, or downplaying of these.
> The "took me by a huge surprise" review.

#### Three observations about perf reviews at tech companies

> Trust between employee and manager is the most likely to break as a result of a poor perf review. 

> Too few engineering managers put meaningful time into writing perf reviews that have feedback of substance. [...] Lack of time is also often used as a poor excuse for the lack of thoughtfulness.

> My biggest disappointment with perf reviews were never with the numbers - even if they were below what I expected. They were because of the lack of acknowledgment of my work, and lack of reflection on my achievements and growth. While managers don't always have control of the numbers, they always have full control of how they say - or don't say - thank you.

#### How I do performance reviews

> I set goals on the outcome of the performance review: [...] Fair, unbiased and clear feedback. [...] Motivate: Starting with acknowledging all the good work, and talking through what to focus on next. [...] Trust: This requires, at the very least, the review to be an honest and two-way conversation.

#### Preparing for the review: months before

> Understanding their goals and motivations. [...]  I always make it clear that their career is in their hands: that is, don't expect someone else to drive this. However, as a manager, they should expect from me - and hold me accountable - to give regular feedback, create opportunities for growth and mentor/coach [...] Regular 1:1 meetings [...] Clarifying the difference between promotions and professional growth.

#### Preparing for the review: weeks before

> Collecting the substance of "what" and the "how" is where I spend most of my time. [...] 1:1 notes. [...] Projects the engineer worked on [...] code, documentation, emails. [...] peer feedback, thanks they received over email or other means, and other feedback I can find. [...] code reviews, planning documentation reviews, interactions with others [...] Self-review.

#### Writing the review

> Listing out "what" was done [...] This list has three purposes. First, it acknowledges the work they did. Second, I make sure to pause on delivery and ask them if I left anything of impact out. If I did, we add it. Third, it usually reassures people that this a fair review - and people are often surprised at the details this list contains. It's a reflection of how much I've prepared for this meeting.

> Using the work done, and the "how" of it was done, I determine if this person met, exceeded or was below the given competency. [...] I always provide examples, and specific feedback for improvement.

> Short summary: I add this summary to the bottom, making it clear where this person is against their level, and how close - or far - they are to promotion to the next level. [...] I summarize three things I would focus on for faster growth, if I were them.

> Comparing pref reviews of people, side by side - with special focus on high- and low performers and people who are different to me. Did I hold the same bar? Am I using similar language and tone to call out achievments, or shortcomings?

#### Delivering the review

> I always have a separate performance feedback, and a separate compensation meeting. I've tried different setups, and this is the one that worked best for quality discussions, and feedback. As soon as people hear their compensation numbers, their brain re-focuses and any conversation about improvement is moot.

#### After the review

> I shoot the review we talked through, over email. I know some people take plenty of time to read through this. 

> When people don't agree with parts of the feedback, we do follow up-meeting very soon.

#### Principles for fair performance reviews

> Use these specifics when giving feedback. Instead of giving feedback on the person writing bad code, be specific. If collaboration could be better, use a specific project example. When praising, do the same.

> People really appreciate getting quality feedback.

> Good perf reviews lead to more trust, faster growth and less attrition.
