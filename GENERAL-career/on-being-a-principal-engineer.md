Elevator Pitch

This blog post defines the groundwork that a successful principal engineer provides to a team and organization, and how it both differs and contributes to the role of a regular "people manager".

Notable Quotes
------
> It is not that I disliked managers or that I think it is easy work. To the contrary, I very much appreciate the complexity of engineering management work but I felt that I wanted to strengthen my technical expertise and solidify my career as an individual contributor before considering going fully into people management.

> I also realized that while I am still an individual contributor, the principal engineer role carries enough cross-organization work, and enough people skills, that it is much closer to management than it may seem without engineers reporting directly to me.

>  I have heard it said about data stores that ‘all databases have schemas…even the ones that say they do not’ and I think the same applies to organizations that are larger than a small handful of individuals.

> When companies’ engineering teams grow past a handful, the engineering leadership has to document explicitly what they consider are the competencies of a senior engineer, not leave that up to interpretation. Implied competencies are easily colored by personal bias, both implicit and explicit. And these biases are a quick way to lose competent engineers.

> For an engineer to get to the Principal Engineer level, there needs to be cross organizational collaborative signals, there needs to be a clear understanding of architecture and design decisions that go far beyond the immediate technical area of expertise.

> A truly valuable PE makes their whole team better by advocating for best practices, gently reminding people of why the processes we have exist, and helping the less experienced engineers find ways to ‘level up’. A good PE can speak to technical aspects of the product, connect planned work to business strategy and to what makes the company more successful and maybe most importantly, have the interpersonal skills to influence others around them towards these goals.

> This is why promoting any engineer to PE without clear skills in more than just ‘the code’ would be a disservice to the team [...] If you want to watch and see how the ‘brilliant jerk’ anecdote came to be, it is those promotions to senior IC titles based solely on code output and not all the value that inter human skills can bring into getting large numbers of humans rowing in the same direction.

> But once i became a principal, it became clear that by virtue of being one of a few, I now carried a larger impact on morale, organization culture and even on recruiting and representing my engineering organization outside of the company.

> The role is far less about solving intricate technology problems (although there is that too) and more about being a good influence, convincing the rest of the technical team why Thing A should be solved with plan Foo and not plan Bar. There is a lot of solving for other people motivations, finding the right message for each audience while still working towards the business goals at the end.

Conclusion
------
> I bought and read The Manager’s Path by the awesome Camille Fournier when it first came out. [...] The title of the book and its stated goal might be laying out the path in engineering management up to senior leadership, but reading it made it clear to me that the book is also of great value to individual contributors to help explain what all these titles mean, what each layer of management is supposed to focus on, and how engineering concerns converge ultimately with business concerns and crystallize into a strategy for a technical organization.
