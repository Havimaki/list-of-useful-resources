Notable Quotes
------ 

> If you get a retention offer, take it and start looking immediately. DO NOT act like you’ve already earned the money.

> The company is not your family [...] don’t stay because you’re comfortable.

> Politics emerge when the players believe the game is zero sum.

> It’s also okay to take risks. Staying at a company that’s slowly dying has its costs too [...] You can take the risk but if you do so, demand some of the upside.

> Yes, your manager matters. But if you have an amazing manager at a shit company you’ll still have a shit time. In some ways, it’ll actually be worse. If they’re good at their job (including retaining you), they’ll keep you at a bad company for too long.

> Your equity package is a lottery ticket with expected value of zero.

> VCs are salespeople for a living [...] Don’t ever join a company solely on the recommendation of a VC.

Conclusion
------

> I worked at a struggling tech company for a couple years, and spent a lot of hours with my friends and colleagues (also in similar situations) examining what we would’ve told our past selves.
