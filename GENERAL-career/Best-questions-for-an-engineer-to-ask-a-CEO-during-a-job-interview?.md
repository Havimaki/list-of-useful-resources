Notable Quotes
------
> I like to dig into culture (which is always top down), and empathy. I want to know whether the CEO considers employees people or a resource.

> Honesty, acknowledgement of problems, and transparency are the things to look for.

> If you want to ask something about decisions, ask something like "Do you favor consensus or autonomy in decision making?" or "How do junior team members influence team decisions?"

> The most important question you need to ask is to yourself when you walk out of the meeting:
1- Did I understand their purpose and mission? 2- Was the leader someone inspirational & respectable that I'd be whiling to support during a crisis? 
If you don't understand the mission and if you can't respect them then find something that's more suitable.

Conclusion
------
> I'm interviewing right now at a lot of startups and am looking for better ways to ask “so, where is this thing headed?”. What do you always make sure to ask?
