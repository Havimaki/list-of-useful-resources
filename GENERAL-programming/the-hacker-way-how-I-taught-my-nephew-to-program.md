This blog post outlines four fundamental principles involved when teaching a child to program.

Notable Quotes
------
> Principle A: Learning is Play

> Kids are taught to associate learning with responsibility. Learning is stuff you don’t want to do, but have to because it’s either good for you or will make your parents happy — sort of like broccoli.

> Principle B: Meet them at their interests

> one of the key differences between play and work is freedom: play happens when you’re doing what you want to be doing. 

> If you observe what they’re interested in right now, then form a plan from there, it’s going to be a lot more smooth.

> Principle C: Let kids drop things

> The other difference between play and work, is that you can stop playing any time.

> Principle D: Treat kids like junior apprentices

> We teach kids in two common ways. The first is to form a “classical” environment: [...] what is a string, what is an array, etc. This is often the most boring approach — if a kid doesn’t understand why they need to learn something, it’s much harder to learn it. [...] The second is to form a “kid-size” environment: maybe a dummy programming language that works on kid-style problems. [...] it still suffers from similar problems: the kid doesn’t really understand why they’re doing this. 

> My working approach is to do just that and treat them like junior apprentices. [...] like most apprentices, he did the majority of the research and work: I simply gave the problems, and was available for video calls when he got stuck [...] Like a real apprentice I made sure to treat his questions seriously, and gave him answers that satisfied his curiosity.

Conclusion

> Over the last year, my 13 year old nephew developed a love for hacking. [...] What I’m most proud of though, is that he’s done this with self directed play, rather than with a rigid curriculum. To help him do this, I acted as a yoda in the background. I experimented with a personal teaching philosophy, and I wanted to share the core tenets with you — I call it “The Hacker Way”:
