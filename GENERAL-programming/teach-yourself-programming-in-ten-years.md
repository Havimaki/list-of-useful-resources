Notable Quotes
------ 

> Alan Perlis once said: "A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing".

> As Alexander Pope said, a little learning is a dangerous thing.

> The key is deliberative practice: not just doing it again and again, but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond your current ability, trying it, analyzing your performance while and after doing it, and correcting any mistakes. Then repeat. And repeat again.

> Talk with other programmers; read other programs. This is more important than any book or training course.

> When you're the best [programmer], you get to test your abilities to lead a project, and to inspire others with your vision. When you're the worst, you learn what the masters do, and you learn what they don't like to do (because they make you do it for them).

> Understand a program written by someone else. See what it takes to understand and fix it when the original programmers are not around. Think about how to design your programs to make it easier for those who will maintain them after you.

> Get involved in a language standardization effort, [...] Have the good sense to get off the language standardization effort as quickly as possible.

Conclusion
------

> So go ahead and buy that Java/Ruby/Javascript/PHP book; you'll probably get some use out of it. But you won't change your life, or your real overall expertise as a programmer in 24 hours or 21 days. How about working hard to continually improve over 24 months? Well, now you're starting to get somewhere...
