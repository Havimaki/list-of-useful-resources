Elevator Pitch
------ 
This article summarizes how to avoid building bad software, by reusing existing software, building for complexity and hiring great engineers who will make the right decisions.

Notable Quotes
------ 

> The root cause of bad software has less to do with specific engineering choices, and more to do with how development projects are managed.


> * Reusing good software is easy; it is what allows you to build good things quickly.
> * Software is limited not by the amount of resources put into building it, but by how complex it can get before it breaks down.
> * The main value in software is not the code produced, but the knowledge accumulated by the people who produced it.

> 1. Start as simple as possible;
> 2. Seek out problems and iterate; and
> 3. Hire the best engineers you can.

> This is known as “technical debt” and is the main challenge in professional software development. It is the reason why many large IT systems have issues that go unfixed for years. Adding more engineers to the project just adds to the chaos: they start running faster in place as the codebase keels over from its own weight.

> Building good software involves alternating cycles of expanding and reducing complexity.

> The challenge is managing this cycle, letting it get messy enough to make meaningful progress, but not letting it get so complicated that it becomes overwhelming.

> To make progress, you need to start with a bunch of bad ideas, discard the worst, and evolve the most promising ones.

> Software should be treated not as a static product, but as a living manifestation of the development team’s collective understanding.

> Software projects rarely fail because they are too small; they fail because they get too big.

>  The aim is not yet to build the final product, but to first identify these problems as quickly and as cheaply as possible.

> Small feedback loops allow for quick and easy correction but miss out on broader issues. Large feedback loops catch broader issues but are slow and expensive. You want to use both, resolving as much as possible with tight loops while still having wide loops to catch unexpected errors.

> Both Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg have said that the best engineers are at least 10 times more productive than an average engineer. This is not because good engineers write code 10 times faster. It is because they make better decisions that save 10 times the work.

> Building software is not about avoiding failure; it is about strategically failing as fast as possible to get the information you need to build something good.

Conclusion
------

> Good software development starts with building a clear understanding of the problem you want to solve. This lets you test many possible solutions and converge on a good approach. Development is accelerated by reusing the right open source code and cloud services, granting immediate access to established software systems and sophisticated new technology. The development cycle alternates between exploration and consolidation, quickly and messily progressing on new ideas, then focusing and simplifying to keep the complexity manageable. As the project moves forward, it gets tested with successively larger groups of people to eliminate increasingly uncommon problems. Launching is when the real work ramps up for a good development team: layers of automated systems should be built to handle issues quickly and prevent harm to actual users. Ultimately, while there are infinite intricacies to software development, understanding this process provides a basis to tackle the complexities of how to build good software.
