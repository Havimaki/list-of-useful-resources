Notable Quotes
------ 

> A fully objective rubric would be brittle, and would incentivize the growth of a team with homogenous skills.

> One of the key ways we hope to reduce the problem of bias is by moving away from all-or-nothing, twice-yearly assessments. We have observed that these are frequently opaque, frustrating and stressful for engineers, who see them as one of a limited number of high-stakes opportunities to demonstrate progress.

> While engineers are in principle free to choose their own path, the realities of building a team and product will sometimes require compromise on their part. This is a healthy thing to discuss as part of career planning.

> * Conscious: having devoted intentional effort to this endeavour,
> * Comfortable: without being overly stretched,
> * Continuous: for a reasonable period of time,
> * Consistent: reliably and evenly,
> * Competency: meeting the criteria.

> The aim should be that when the formal assessment is made, neither the group lead nor the engineer are surprised by the outcome.

> Group leads should use the regular check-ins to effectively set expectations, so a senior engineer doesn’t wonder why they appear to be making no visible progress, even as they believe they are improving.

Conclusion

> We recently undertook a project to define professional development for members of Medium’s engineering team. [This is the actual document used by Medium to help understand how we assess progress](https://snowflake.medium.com/#1,2,3,2,4,1,1,4,3,2,0,4,2,2,3,0,Cersei%20Lannister,Staff%20Engineer)
